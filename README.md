# Gomoku

A simple two player Gomoku application written in JavaScript using the React framework/library. This project was originally created for the online version of [CS50x 2022](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/).

## What is Gomoku

Gomoku, alse frequently called 'five in a row' is a strategic board game for two players. It has strong similarities to Tic Tac Toe, but instead of the need to align three symbols to win, Gomoku requires five stones in a row (horizontal, vertical or diagonal). Both players start placing black or white stones on the intersection of the board until one player wins or the game ties. Black starts the game.
